# Azure Serverless Workshop

## Overview

Imagine spending your time building and deploying great applications without the burden of managing servers. This is possible with serverless computing, where you no longer have to plan for or manage the infrastructure required to support your apps. With serverless, you can focus your efforts on the business logic and innovation that will bring your great apps to market faster.

In this full-day, challenge-based workshop, you will learn about designing and building serverless solutions on Azure. You’ll experience hands-on time writing and publishing your code with [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/), building workflows and integrating with other services using [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/), and protecting and managing your APIs with [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/), and building reactive, event-driven solutions using [Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-grid/). We will even share a few tips of a solution for migrating serverless workloads with just a few lines of code using the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/)!

Your code, logic, integration and imagination is all you need to bring – the serverless platform will take care of the rest.

## Preface

<img style="float: right;" height="160" src="https://serverlessoh.azureedge.net/public/ice-cream-2202561_320-circle.jpg" />

**Best For You Organics Company (BFYOC)** is an ice cream company with over 200 stores worldwide. BFYOC has focused on fresh ingredients, locally sourced, and seasonal. Their 26 flavors range from the ordinary vanilla, to the ever popular avocado toast (which is a much better flavor than it sounds). They are now creating a new line of fruit flavored ice creams and are preparing to launch onto the market.

Because premium ingredients are key to their success, their profit margins are relatively low, as they try to keep prices affordable for consumers. As such, every sale needs to be optimized, and every customer needs to leave happy. They also need to cut costs whenever possible, which of course impacts their budget for new technology.

BFYOC would like to launch a new customer feedback tool to analyze their sales and customer satisfaction levels. Because feedback posts from customers will be sporadic, they are looking for options that can automatically scale, and minimize investment in infrastructure.
